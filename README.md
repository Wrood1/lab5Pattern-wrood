## Facade Design Pattern

**Definition**

- The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a subsystem, defining a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

**Benefits**

1. **Simplicity:** Simplifies the complex interactions of a subsystem, providing an easy-to-use interface.
2. **Decoupling:** Reduces dependencies by providing a single entry point to the subsystem, decoupling the client from its components.
3. **Maintenance:** Eases maintenance by encapsulating subsystem changes within the Facade.

**When to Use**

- Use the Facade pattern when:
  1. Providing a simple interface to a complex subsystem.
  2. Decoupling the client from the inner workings of a subsystem.
  3. Creating a unified interface for a set of interfaces in a subsystem
 
## Adapter Design Pattern

**Definition**
The Adapter pattern serves as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, enabling them to work together without altering their original code. It essentially allows one interface to be used as if it were another, facilitating communication between systems or components that otherwise could not interact due to mismatched interfaces.

**Benefits**

Reusability: Enables the reuse of existing classes or systems that have incompatible interfaces, by adapting them to work together.
Flexibility: Provides the ability to adapt existing classes or systems to new interfaces or requirements, enhancing the design's flexibility without changing the original code.
Interoperability: Ensures systems or components with different interfaces can collaborate, thereby improving interoperability among systems.

**When to Use**
The Adapter pattern is particularly useful in situations such as:

Integrating Existing Systems: When you need to integrate systems that have different interfaces, the Adapter pattern can make them compatible with each other.
Reusing Existing Classes: If you want to reuse existing classes in a new system that requires a different interface, using an adapter can solve interface incompatibility issues.
Working with Multiple Third-party Libraries: In scenarios where your system needs to interact with multiple third-party libraries that have varying interfaces, the Adapter pattern can unify these interfaces, allowing your system to work seamlessly with these libraries.
