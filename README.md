Facade Design Pattern

**Definition**

- The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a subsystem, defining a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

**Benefits**

1. **Simplicity:** Simplifies the complex interactions of a subsystem, providing an easy-to-use interface.
2. **Decoupling:** Reduces dependencies by providing a single entry point to the subsystem, decoupling the client from its components.
3. **Maintenance:** Eases maintenance by encapsulating subsystem changes within the Facade.

**When to Use**

- Use the Facade pattern when:
  1. Providing a simple interface to a complex subsystem.
  2. Decoupling the client from the inner workings of a subsystem.
  3. Creating a unified interface for a set of interfaces in a subsystem
 

Facade Design Pattern

Definition:
The Facade pattern offers a simplified interface to a complex subsystem by introducing a higher-level interface. This simplification makes the subsystem more accessible and easier to use.

Key Advantages:

1. Simplicity: It simplifies the subsystem's complex interactions by providing an easier-to-use interface.
2. Decoupling: By offering a single entry point to the subsystem, it minimizes dependencies and decouples the client from the subsystem's components.
3. Maintenance: Facilitates easier maintenance by encapsulating changes to the subsystem within the Facade itself, shielding clients from direct impact.
When to Use:
The Facade pattern is particularly useful in scenarios such as:

Simplifying access to a complex subsystem by providing a straightforward interface.
Decoupling a client from the intricate inner workings of a subsystem to promote loose coupling.
Unifying a set of interfaces in a subsystem under a single, simplified interface, making it easier for clients to interact with the subsystem.
